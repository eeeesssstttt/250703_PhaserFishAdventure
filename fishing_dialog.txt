As you pull the fish ot of the water, a single yellow eye facing you, it speaks:
"I'll answer any question you have, if you release me."
+ (release the fish) -> _1strelease
+ (don't release the fish) -> nonrelease

===_1strelease===
You drop the fish back into the water.
It swims in circles, waiting.
+ Why do fish bite when there's no bait? -> message
+ What's in the water? -> water
+ Do fish feel pain? -> fishpain

===message===
"Because the ones who speak want to send a message." -> keepfishing

===water===
"There's a fine green mist near the surface." -> keepfishing

===fishpain===
"Yes."-> keepfishing

===keepfishing===
Keep fishing?
+ Yes -> _2ndfish
+ No -> end

===_2ndfish===
As you wait for another fish to bite, your thoughts wander. 
You feel a powerful fish pull the line deep into the water.
You try to draw it out and preserve your fishing pole. 
Its pale face appears near the surface.
The line snaps. -> end

===nonrelease===
You decide to keep the fish and put it in your plastic bucket. The fish flops around sadly. -> keepfishing

===end===
You walk away from the water. New Jersey fish are a special kind.
